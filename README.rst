Handle any Rhasspy MQTT messages on a Raspberry Pi and Rhasspy powered voice
assistant.

Current plan is simply to handle volume control on wake, but may eventually
move LED control to this code base, and may handle other skills down the
line.

See `Rhasspy MQTT docs <https://rhasspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/#mqtt-api>`_
for more info on the MQTT messages that can potentially be handled.
